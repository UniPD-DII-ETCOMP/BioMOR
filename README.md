# BioMOR 

This directory contains a code based on FFT and Moder Ordel Reduction for the parametruc analysis of electromagnetic fields and voxel-based human body interaction

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Description
 
- "FFT_SingleSolution.m"  solves a single problem with a frequency value and nominal resistivity
- "FFT_MORfreq.m"         generates a Reduced Order Model (ROM) with frequency as parameter
- "FFT_MORres.m"          generates a Reduced Order Model (ROM) with resistivity as parameter

All user-settable quantities, e.g. frequency, are contained in the block identified by the 
```BEGIN USER SETTINGS``` / ```END USER SETTINGS``` comments.

Available test cases
--------------------
A simple test case is contained in separate directories under the folder "data". 
Set the "name_dir" variable in "FFT_SingleSolution.m", "FFT_MORfreq.m", "FFT_MORres.m"
to the appropriate directory.

User-defined test cases
-----------------------
Follow the instuctions given in "README.txt" inside the "data" directory.

Results and Visualization
--------------------
In the "res_para" directory, the results generated by 
"FFT_SingleSolution.m", "FFT_MORfreq.m", "FFT_MORres.m" are exported in 
Paraview format.
The Reduced Order Models can be used as shown in the "USE MOR" sections of  "FFT_MORfreq.m" and "FFT_MORres.m"
